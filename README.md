User Story:
Be able to browse a community-created manga catalogue. Users can find detailed information, comments, where to buy each manga. Making an account allows the user to add comments, add/edit manga details, and delete manga (please don't abuse).

Technologies Used:
HTML, CSS, Flexbox, Media Query, JavaScript, Node.js, Mongoose, MongoDB, Express, EJS, EJS Partials, Method Override, BCrypt, DotENV, Sessions, Heroku Deployment

Approach Taken:
I first wanted to get my basic CRUD app working barebones. I then added the ability to make an account and made it so the user can add/edit/delete manga, and make comments if they are signed in.

Unsolved Problems:
Comments not working at all (resolved)

Future features:
Give signed in users the ability to keep track of the chapters they are currently reading.

Pull manga information from the MyAnimeList API.
